# Assessment: How to submit {.unnumbered}

You must submit a `.pdf` file, that is a rendered version of a Quarto Markdown file (`qmd` file). 
This will allow you to write a research paper that also includes your working code, without the need of including the data (rendered `.qmd` files are executed before being converted to R).

How to get a PDF?

1.  **Install Quarto**: Make sure you have Quarto installed. You can download it from quarto.org.
2.  **LaTeX Installation**: For PDF output, youâ€™ll need a LaTeX distribution like **TinyTeX** from R, by executing this in the R console:
        
```r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
   
3.  **Open the Quarto File**: Open your `.qmd` file in RStudio.
4.  **Set Output Format**: In the YAML header at the top of your Quarto file, specify `pdf` under `format`:

```{r class.source = "fold-show", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/quartoHeader.png")
```
    
```
    title: "Your Document Title"
    author: "Anonymous" # do not change
    format: pdf
```  

5.  Click the **Render** button in the RStudio toolbar (next to the Knit button).
