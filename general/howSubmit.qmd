# Assessment: How to submit {.unnumbered}

Normally you don't need to do so, but if something does not work, you may have to install [Quarto](quarto.org). Recent versions of RStudio do not require you to do so. installed.

## .html file

You can submit a `.html` file, that is a rendered version of a Quarto Markdown file (`qmd` file). This will allow you to write a research paper that also includes your working code, without the need of including the data (rendered `.qmd` files are executed before being converted to R).

To do so, at the top of your document, include something like this in a YAML cell (see [Template](https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/84668/files/13173146?module_item_id=2459687), in RStudio, "visual view", `Insert`, `YAML block`)

```         
title: "Assignment 1"
author: "Anonymous" # do not change
format:
  html:
	self-contained: true
``` 

Once your document is ready with your text and code, render the Quarto document: Click the **Render** button in the RStudio toolbar (blue arrow). This, if everything works (code, existing data, etc), will create an `.html` file in the same location as your `.qmd` file

## .pdf file: More complicated

If you really want to render your `.qmd` file into a `.pdf` file, you need to follow a more complicated path.

**LaTeX Installation**: you’ll need a LaTeX distribution like **TinyTeX** from R.

1.  Execute this in the RStudio **console** (bottom):

``` r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

2.  **Open the Quarto File**: Open your `.qmd` file in RStudio.
3.  **Set Output Format**: In the YAML header at the top of your Quarto file, specify `pdf` under `format`:

```{r class.source = "fold-show", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/quartoHeader.png")
```

```         
title: "Assignment 1"
author: "Anonymous" # do not change
format: pdf
```

4.  Click the **Render** button in the RStudio toolbar (blue arrow).
